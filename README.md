# Digit Recogniser Using ANN From Scratch

A simple implementation of Artificial Neural Network to recognise hand written digits. The ANN has been implemented from scratch without using any python AI/ML modules.

<br>

The project has been divided into two parts as follows:
1. Model Training (Checkout ann.py in src to go through the training of the model.)
2. Model Hosting (The current program hosts the model on a localhost using Python Flask.)

Note: You don't need to train the model to use it, 3 trained models are already provided in the repo.

<br>

To run the program, simply clone this repo and execute the following command in the parent directory:

```
python3 app.py
```

This will start a localhost server. You can than use the app on your browser. Draw a digit on the canvas (or you can upload an image) and press the `Identify` button. That's all.
